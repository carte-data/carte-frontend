Carte is a static site generator for data catalogs. It takes a predefined folder structure with markdown files (with YAML frontmatter), and generates an instantly searchable, fast, and statically deployable data catalog site.

**See a demo site here: [demo.cartedata.com](https://demo.cartedata.com)**

* Carte has a sister library, [Flyover](https://github.com/carte-data/flyover) that connects to your data sources and generates these markdown files that Carte operates out of.
* This site can then be edited with the bundled Netlify CMS system, and changes made to dataset descriptions are committed back to the repo.
* Flyover preserves any comments and descriptions added with the CMS, so it can be run periodically to pick up changes to the data schema.
* Using Git as the source of truth enables metadata versioning, rollback, and conflict resolution
